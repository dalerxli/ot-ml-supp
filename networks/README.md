## Networks
Pre-trained networks using in the paper.
These networks can be loaded into Matlab with

or into Python using

# 3dof-position
Networks trained to estimate the optical force on a particle in
a single circularly polarised Gaussian beam.
This directory contains 10 groups of networks trained on the same
data set with different numbers of hidden nodes.
By averaging the predictions of multiple networks, the estimated
optical force becomes more accurate.
If you only want a single network, use [3dof-position/0/nn3dof_size_256.h5].

# 5dof-position-size-ri
Networks trained to estimate the optical force on a spherical particle
with different size and refractive index at different positions in
a single circularly polarised Gaussian beam.
This folder contains 7 networks with different numbers of hidden nodes.
