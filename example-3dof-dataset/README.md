# Example 3-DOF dataset
This directory contains an example 3-DOF data set and a Jupyter
notebook for training a 3-DOF network.
The 3-DOF data set, `input.mat` contains force and position information
for a spherical particle in a circularly polarised Gaussian beam.
The dataset contains 1,000,000 data points.
For similar pre-trained networks, see `../networks/3dof-position/`.
